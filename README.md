# R-Econ
This is a collection of slides from past R meetings. We meet every couple of weeks or months to discuss helpful tools from the R ecosystem for our research.
Topics range from basic housekeeping tools, data acquisition, manipulation and visualisation to
estimation, inference, reproducibility, and publication of research results. The meeting language is either English or German.

If you would like to be informed about meetings or to present at one of them, you are very welcome to contact

## Other meetups

Of course, there are plenty of R meetups around, in Germany and elsewhere. See [this list](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/r-user-groups.html) of R user groups, [rladies.org](https://rladies.org/), or [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/). Our aim is to place a stronger focus on tools and use cases closer to economic research and to offer a venue for connecting with like-minded folks.

## Past

The meetings were originally held at DIW Berlin and were organised by a group of PhD students. They have now moved online.
